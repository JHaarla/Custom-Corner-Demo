                <h3 class="text-center">Welcome to the Custom Corner Demo Site</h3>
                <p>The purpose of Custom Corner is to streamline an interior designer's workflow by aggregating data
                    from various vendors and then sharing the collection with their clients. Since the live deployment
                    of Custom Corner is used by a company and only allows authenticated users, this site serves as a
                    demonstration of the app's functionality. Custom Corner is a full stack MERN (Mongo, Express, React,
                    Node) app that scrapes various vendor's sites for data to be displayed. The user has the ability to
                    filter through this aggregated data and make selections to be shared with their clients. Sharing can
                    be done through Pinterest or there is a built-in PDF creator that makes sharing easy as well. Let's
                    explore the functionality of Custom Corner!</p>

                <p>Custom Corner is hosted on the Google Cloud platform and is currently using Docker to run the
                    application. There are multiple containers running on the server:</p>
                <li>Mongo - Houses the database for the application</li>
                <li>NGINX - performs reverse proxy and handles SSL. Also redirects http connections to https</li>
                <li>Certbot - Automates renewing the SSL certification through Let's Encrypt</li>
                <li>Node - Runs the React app</li>

                <p>Once the user is on the landing page, they will be able to login with the administrator provided
                    credentials. Access to Custom Corner without credentials is not allowed. Clicking the "Login" button
                    brings up a modal where the user's credentials can be entered. Please see the video to see this in

                    manage the clients in the system. By selecting different clients, the user can add itens to the
                    correct collections. Also, when deleting a client, all associated saved items in that collection get
                    purged from the database. Please see the video for an example.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Displaying Data, Filtering & The Tackboard</h4>
                <p>The Tackboard is where all saved items for each client will be displayed so they can be further
                    shared. It is sort of a staging area. Once a client is selected, the user can can sort through all
                    the aggregated data to make their selections. The Navigation items are dynamically populated from
                    the scrapes. Only the available items are displayed. All the data is categorized by room type into
                    further subcategories. The filtering works via toggle switches. They are attached to each vendor. By
                    toggling a vendor on/off, that vendors items will be either shown or hidden. This happens in real
                    time. To add an item to the Tackboard, the user will click the red thumbtack in the upper right
                    corner of each item card. Once an item is added to the Tackboard there is a toast notification
                    letting the user know the selection was successful. Multiple clicks will add multiple iterations of
                    the item. Each item has a description line. If the description is longer than the card has to
                    display, the text scrolls by hovering over it. If the user needs more information about any
                    particular item, there is also a link back to the Vendor's site directly to the item. Please see the
                    video for a demonstration.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Pinterest Integration</h4>
                <p>Once the user is ready to share the collection of items with their client, they can save the items to
                    a Pinterest board of their choice. (Sharing via Pinterest was a request by the client) Clicking on
                    the red "Save" button at the top right of the Tackboard brings up a window that allows the user to
                    select an item to add to a Pinterest board. The pinned item will also link back to the original
                    vendor's URL for that item. If the user is not currently logged into a Pinterest account, they are
                    prompted to sign in or create an account first. Another way of sharing the collection is via the
                    "Create BOM" button right below the Pinterest button. This creates a PDF that can be downloaded and
                    shared. The PDF also has links back to the original vendor for each item. Please see the video for a
                    demonstration.</p>
