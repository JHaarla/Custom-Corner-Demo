                <h3 class="text-center">Welcome to the Custom Corner Demo Site</h3>
                <p>The purpose of Custom Corner is to streamline an interior designer's workflow by aggregating data
                    from various vendors and then sharing the collection with their clients. Since the live deployment
                    of Custom Corner is used by a company and only allows authenticated users, this site serves as a
                    demonstration of the app's functionality. Custom Corner is a full stack MERN (Mongo, Express, React,
                    Node) app that scrapes various vendor's sites for data to be displayed. The user has the ability to
                    filter through this aggregated data and make selections to be shared with their clients. Sharing can
                    be done through Pinterest or there is a built-in PDF creator that makes sharing easy as well. Let's
                    explore the functionality of Custom Corner!</p>

                <p>Custom Corner is hosted on the Google Cloud platform and is currently using Docker to run the
                    application. There are multiple containers running on the server:</p>
                <li>Mongo - Houses the database for the application</li>
                <li>NGINX - performs reverse proxy and handles SSL. Also redirects http connections to https</li>
                <li>Certbot - Automates renewing the SSL certification through Let's Encrypt</li>
                <li>Node - Runs the React app</li>

                <p>When the user selects "Clients" from the dropdown menu, they'll be brought to a page where they can manage the clients in the system. By selecting different clients, the user can add itens to the correct collections. Also, when deleting a client, all associated saved items in that collection get purged from the database. Please see the video for an example.</p>

                <p>The Tackboard is where all saved items for each client will be displayed so they can be further shared. It is sort of a staging area. Once a client is selected, the user can can sort through all the aggregated data to make their selections. All the data is categorized by room type into further subcategories. The filtering works via toggle switches. They are attached to each vendor. By toggling a vendor on/off, that vendors items will be either shown or hidden. This happens in real time. To add an item to the Tackboard, the user will click the red thumbtack in the upper right corner of each item card. Once an item is added to the Tackboard there is a toast notification letting the user know the selection was successful. Multiple clicks will add multiple iterations of the item. Each item has a description line. If the description is longer than the card has to display, the text scrolls by hovering over it. If the user needs more information about any particular item, there is also a link back to the Vendor's site directly to the item. Please see the vide for a demonstration.</p>
